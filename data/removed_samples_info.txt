Two patients were removed because they were on Rituximab:
Case08 #ACPA_neg
Case59 #ACPA_pos

Five samples were deemed as outliers and were therefore removed:
Case43 #ACPA_neg
Case19 #ACPA_neg
Control3 #control
Control14 #control
Control33 #control

Six RA samples did not have CDAI information and were therefore removed from the analysis in Fig. 4:
Case01 #ACPA_neg
Case03 #ACPA_pos
Case31 #ACPA_neg
Case52 #ACPA_neg
Case53 #ACPA_pos
Case57 #ACPA_pos
